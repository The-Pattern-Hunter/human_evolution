    "2. **Similarity Patterns**: \n",

    "   - Does this match what you know about primate evolution?\n",
    "   - Why is human-chimpanzee similarity not 100%?\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Conservation**: \n",
    "   - Some positions were conserved (*), others variable (.)\n",
    "   - Why might some positions be more conserved than others?\n",
    "   - What does conservation tell us about natural selection?\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **The Alignment Problem**:\n",
    "   - We compared sequences position-by-position\n",
    "   - But what if one species has an insertion or deletion?\n",
