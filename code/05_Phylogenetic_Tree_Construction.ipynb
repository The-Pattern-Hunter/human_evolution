    "\n",
    "### What You've Learned:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Evolutionary Distance**\n",
    "   - Distance matrices quantify sequence differences\n",
    "   - Different models account for different mutation patterns\n",
    "   - Distance is foundation for tree building\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Tree Building Methods**\n",
    "   - **UPGMA**: Simple, assumes molecular clock\n",
    "   - **Neighbor Joining**: More realistic, no clock assumption\n",
    "   - Different methods can give different trees!\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Tree Confidence**\n",
    "   - Bootstrap analysis tests reliability\n",
    "   - High bootstrap values = well-supported branches\n",
    "   - Low values = uncertain relationships\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Tree Interpretation**\n",
    "   - Branch lengths show evolutionary change\n",
    "   - Topology shows relationships\n",
    "   - Rooting determines evolutionary direction\n",
    "\n",
    "### Real Biology:\n",
    "- Humans and chimpanzees are sister species (diverged ~6-7 MYA)\n",
    "- Great apes form a clade\n",
    "- Old World monkeys are more distantly related\n",
    "- Lemurs are even more distant (prosimians)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Skills Acquired:\n",
    "- Calculating evolutionary distances\n",
    "- Building phylogenetic trees (UPGMA, NJ)\n",
    "- Bootstrap analysis for tree support\n",
    "- Tree visualization and interpretation\n",
    "- Understanding tree topology\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps:\n",
    "Move to Notebook 4: **Tree Interpretation and Evolutionary Analysis** to learn how to extract biological insights from phylogenetic trees!\n",

    "## Questions to Think About\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Method Comparison**: Why might UPGMA and NJ give different trees? Which do you trust more?\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Bootstrap Values**: What does a bootstrap value of 65% mean biologically? Should we trust that branch?\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Branch Lengths**: If one species has much longer branches than others, what might explain this?\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Molecular Clock**: Does our tree support a molecular clock? How can you tell?\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Rooting**: Why does root placement matter? How does it change our interpretation?\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Real Evolution**: How well does our tree match what we know about primate evolution from fossils and anatomy?\n",
    "\n",
    "Think about these as we explore tree interpretation in the next notebook!"
